This is a project to devlop a rover that is controlled via a raspberry pi.

The first part of the project is simply to change over the code that was writtend of an arduino and run in on a raspberry pi. Most of the code will be written in C++, the main reason for this is to achieve the fasted computational speed for the least resources. Thus leaving the processor free to perform other operations as needed. 

The project uses the wiringpi library http://wiringpi.com/

The rover should be work out were it is from the distance travelled by each wheel. The are 5 IR sensors to check for possible collistions.
